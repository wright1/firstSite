      <div id="heading"><h1>Falling in Love with code...begrudingly!</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph" id="intro"><p>
      I have heard people confess their undeniable love for coding, they have a 'love at first sight' experience
      with coding. I am envious. My relationship with coding is no where near as clear cut. We're in a good place at
      the moment, but that may not last. Our relationship is a collection of experiences, I try not to filter
      those experience into 'good' and 'bad'. However, there was a time that we were out and out enemies for the
      following reasons:
      </p>	
      </div>

      <div class="sub-heading" id="sub-1"><h2>Coding is Judgemental</h2></div>
      <div class="paragraph" id="para-1"><p>
      Imagine you had a friend that called out every single mistake you made, every single time with a large red
      error message, how long do you think that relationship will last? Well, speaking for myself I can say that 
      relationship would not see the dawn of day! NEXT! May I request a friend with a little more compassion and
      understanding and a little less judgement please, thank you very much.
      </p>	
      </div>

      <div class="sub-heading" id="sub-2"><h2>Coding kept stalking me</h2></div>
      <div class="paragraph" id="para-2"><p>
      Many times I tried to leave Coding. I didn't feel good enough, every time I tried to make this relationship
      work error messages were thrown. So like any sensible gal I decided to leave. Find something new.
      </p>	
      </div>

      <div class="gif" id="gif-1"><img src="Images/goodbye.gif" alt=" Image of the word goodbye"></div>

      <div class="paragraph" id="para-3"><p>
      But Coding wouldn't leave me alone. I would be sitting down to my favourite breakfast of porriage oats topped
      with fresh banana and strawberries when Coding would pop up, 'we can make this work, maybe if you tried an array.....'
      On my way to work I would find myself trying to figure out how the 'this' keyword works. However hard I tried to
      walk away Coding was there. 

      </p>	
      </div>

      <div class="sub-heading" id="sub-3"><h2>Something Changed</h2></div>
      <div class="paragraph" id="para-4"><p>
      A simple act made a drastic change to my relationship with Coding. I did something I hadn't done before...I 
      actually READ the error messages I was receiving. Yes, I know, Radical!</p>
      <p>
      You see, at a glance error messages seemed ineligible to me, like something written in a foreign language. It didn't 
      occur to me that the message was trying to communicate something helpful, maybe even useful to me.
      </p>	
      </div>

      <div class="gif" id="gif-2"><img src="Images/shock.gif" alt="Man with surprised look on his face"></div>

      <div class="paragraph" id="para-5"><p>
      I had no idea there were different 'types' of error messages. Maybe I was getting Coding all wrong. Maybe what I was calling 
      judgement was actually support and what I termed stalking was actually persistence, an unwillingness to give up. And it
      was in this realisation that our relationship turned a corner.</br>
      So, lesson learnt. Communication is key. Read the Error messages, they could save your relationship!
